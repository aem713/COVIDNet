# COVID-19 Prediction Model From Audio Data
-------------------------
Project Description
-----------------------
DSCI 400 COVID-19 Audio Project
This process is to create a predictive model for COVID-19 from a set of audio files.
Broadly, the steps are  data cleaning, generating and normalizing Mel-spectrograms and handcrafted features, testing and training a model composed of a CNN and a Perceptron, and validation of the results.
