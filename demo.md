#DSCI 400 Audio Classification DEMO
Files can be run locally but will require the installation of the plugins and python version listed in "README.md".
Alternative method is to access the corresponding files in Google Colab.
Currently Github is not opening up .ipynb files in colab correctly. As such, use the Google Drive link to the following folder to access working version of the .ipynb files.

-------------------------------------------------
.ipynb files are setup to run on Google Colab, but files under "Coswara Original Files" must be uploaded to the Google Drive of the account that is going to run the .ipynb files. To run locally, Juypter Notebook or Labs is recommended.


DEMO/Tutorial
--------------------------------
To use the various features in this project, run the corresponding .ipynb file in the folder you want to use.
For example, to use the Data Wrangling feature, simply run the .ipynb file in the "Data Wrangling" folder. In this case, that .ipynb file is "DSCI_400_Audio_Regroup.ipynb".  (In future updates, file names and folder names will be more similar for improved clarity).
